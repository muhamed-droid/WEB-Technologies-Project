# WEB-Technologies-Project

****************************************************************************

Project is done for subject named Web technologies. Project was based on 4 spirales. I worked on this project on BitBucket as requested. 
First two spirals were frontend programming, third and fourth backend.
In the end this ended in a very big and useful project. Many things were used such as: html, css, javaScript, node, ajax, sessions.
